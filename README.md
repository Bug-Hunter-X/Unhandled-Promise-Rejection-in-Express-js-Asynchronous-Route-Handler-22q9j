# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Asynchronous Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations within route handlers.  The provided code showcases a scenario where an asynchronous function might throw an error.  The error is logged to the console, but the client receives no indication of failure.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations in Express.js route handlers require careful error handling.  Failure to do so can lead to unhandled promise rejections, silent failures, and unpredictable behavior. The original code only logs the error to the console but doesn't send an appropriate error response to the client, leaving the client unaware of the server-side issue.

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block or `.catch()` within the asynchronous operation to properly handle potential errors and send informative error responses back to the client.
